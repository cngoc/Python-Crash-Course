#Use a dictionary to store people's favorite numbers. Think of five names,
#and use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for
#each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person's
#name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get
#some actual data for your program.
